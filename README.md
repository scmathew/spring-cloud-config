# Spring Cloud Config 

Collection of application properties files used as config for the 
[spring-cloud-tutorial](https://github.com/scmathew/spring-cloud-tutorial) project.

Used as a submodule in the `spring-cloud-tutorial` project.

By the default there needs to be a master branch on this repo because
that is what spring cloud looks for.
